<p>yakshav.es is my personal space to scribble, extend and note down. It
is intended to do this in a very simple way: there is no metadata, just
a bunch of files in a directory. Every file is compiled so that it can
be served from a standard webserver where it is reachable under its
name.</p>
<p>Documents are not ordered by publishing date. They might also be
edited at any point in time.</p>
<p>Documents that need a sense of time will bear their initial writing
date in the title.</p>
<p>yakshav.es was created out of the frustration that most static site
generators are rather heavyweight and not built for personal publishing.
Most blogs (even tumblr) have a time component I rarely feel comfortable
with.</p>
<p>It was also created as an attempt to document my work more, as I more
and more feel the need to write things down, without ever having the
feeling that some of it is done. I tend to use Twitter for that, but it
is too short-form and short-lived.</p>
<p>Simplicity doesnâ€™t <a
