<h1 id="save-co.up">Save co.up</h1>
<p>tl;dr: co.up has to shut down if they can’t double their funding until January. Go to <a href="https://co-up.de/support-us/">their support page</a> to support them.</p>
<p>Berlin has a special room: the <a href="https://co-up.de">co.up</a>. Just by looking at it, it’s a rather plain room. That it not to say it is cheap. It has nice audio and video equipment, good chairs. It’s important what happens there.</p>
<p>co.up was originally a part of the coworking space of the same name - but that doesn’t exist anymore. In a weird twist of fate, the owners of co.up got successful with <a href="https://www.cobot.me/">cobot</a>, a management software for coworking spaces and use it as a plain office now.</p>
<p>Since around that time, the community space is funded by the community and still organised by cobot. They did a fundraiser back then that I can - in retrospect - only consider a show of force of the Berlin software community.</p>
<p>Co.up is a free and open space that allows anyone and everyone to run an event under two conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The space wasn’t booked</li>
<li>You would agree to their Code of Conduct</li>
</ul>
<p>For a long time, you could even get a key for their space - but after an unfortunate series of thefts, you had to pick up the key at the coworking space above. And that’s how rigid it got.</p>
<p>This free availability meant that the space was the starting point of a lot of community action:</p>
<ul>
<li>RailsGirls Berlin/CodeCurious ran their first workshops there</li>
<li>Many non-commercial meetups used the space as their default venue
<ul>
<li>Ruby Usergroup Berlin</li>
<li>BerlinJS</li>
<li>Elasticsearch User Group (founded before Elastic was founded)</li>
<li>Rust Berlin</li>
<li>Vagrant Usergroup Berlin</li>
<li>Many OpenTechSchool (OTS) meetups started there</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The RustFest and eurucamp conferences used it as workshop venues</li>
<li>Their events calendar has more: <a href="https://co-up.de/events/">https://co-up.de/events/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The pattern is always the same: the frictionless and availability of the space made it possible for people to setup something new. <a href="https://twitter.com/lauralindal">Laura</a> puts it best:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>co.up is the one space i know that has always supported initiatives because the initiatives do good things, not because it helps co.up to “be more visible” or appear to “support the community”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>co.up has also allowed those initiatives to ramp up massively: * Some OTS learners events are <em>weekly</em> * In total, OTS has over 1000 events in 5 years, a majority in this space!</p>
<p>co.up has been the introduction of a countless number of people into technology.</p>
<p>All in all, co.up is a cornerstone of the free community in Berlin - it’s time for another <a href="https://co-up.de/support-us/">show of force</a>.</p>
