<h1 id="sponsor-skade">Sponsor Skade</h1>
<p>I’m seeking personal sponsorship. For detailed reasoning, see <a href="//sustainability">Sustainabilty</a>.</p>
<p>To help out, <a href="mailto:info@asquera.de">get in touch</a>.</p>
<h2 id="from-whom">From whom?</h2>
<p>I am interested in professional, corporate and company donors of any size.</p>
<p>I’m also fine with conferences and can even offer consulting in return. I don’t do diversity consulting.</p>
<h2 id="how-much">How much?</h2>
<p>I’m seeking at least EUR 15.000 for 2018, either in one-off payments or monthly. I prefer to accept your sponsorship through my company, <a href="http://asquera.de">asquera</a>, for ease. We can also negotiate other forms.</p>
<p>More sponsorship would allow me to do more things.</p>

</ul>
<p>Currently, most of this work happens on evenings. Your support would also allow me to refocus on non-Rust things again.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I have a lot of experience that could be of benefit to the wider FOSS community. I would like to spread/write down: * How to plan and run affortable conferences, especially around budgeting * How to run fair and diverse conferences * How to interact with conferences * Approaches to community development * Writing proposals and speaker mentoring</p>
<p>One of those projects is the <a href="https://github.com/rust-community/foss-events-planner/">FOSS events planner</a>. It’s under the umbrella of the Rust project, but open and intended for all.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-this-sponsorship-not-for">What is this sponsorship not for?</h2>
<p>Expenses and travel, especially speaking expenses. These are either paid by conferences I speak at or through other means.</p>
<h2 id="what-will-i-provide">What will I provide?</h2>
<p>A regular writeup and worklog of things done, at least once a month. On larger sponsorships (&gt;5000), we can also negotiate additional agreements. Also, I’ll present all sponsors on this website and give you thanks :).</p>
