## Abortions

For absurd legal reasons,
doctors in Germany are not allowed to post factual information on abortions
on their websites. _Other_ websites are allowed to post this information,
though. [Frag Den Staat is currently providing resources on the subject in German, English
and Turkish](https://fragdenstaat.de/aktionen/219a/).

If you read this section and were wondering "why the hell, this is not what I'm here for?":
you are entirely correct, but as this information is not allowed to be published where it belongs,
it stays here in protest.
