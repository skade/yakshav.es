# Rust 2019 posts

When starting collecting ideas about this years Rust 2019 post, I had far to many to fit into one document. For that reasons, I'll start writing multiple small pieces. I might come back to them at a later point this year. Most of my wishes are around the project structure, but I also have some technical ones. Most of them deal with the current growth and maturity of the project.

All of these are living documents and even just drafts, so they might change at any time and might be released in draft form.
