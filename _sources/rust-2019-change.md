# Rust 2019 (1): Change

Almost 10 years ago, I visited Japan together with a friend. It was for RubyKaigi 2009, _the_ conference for Ruby. It was my first experience with a conference outside of Europe and definitely an enjoyable one. Ruby back then was at an inflection point: Ruby 1.8 was slowly starting to be the Ruby of the past and Ruby 1.9 came in, shipping breaking changes, but also a _lot_ of fixes around the language core. The Ruby 1.9 introduction was a controversial one, but in my opinion a necessary one. I also think it was well managed, definitely better compared to other such endeavours. But it was definitely a move that the community would still feel for years to come, moving whole existing software stacks isn't easy. Still, Ruby 1.9 was important: it marked a moment of professionalism. Before Ruby became popular through Rails, it was a project with barely enough maintainers, now it had resources to build something. Ruby 1.9 was a lot, but it was definitely a very intentional release.

Now, why am I telling you about Ruby? Because I had an interesting experience there. I'd have expected this conference to be about settling down a little and dealing with what was upcoming. About a little respite. Instead, the motto was a simple word: "Change".

A whole set of conferences was created in the following three years[1], strong debates were had and "Ruby Drama" became a thing. The Ruby community developed its very own style and a lot of projects sprang into existence. Projects like [RailsBridge](http://www.railsbridge.org/) and later the european variant [Rails Girls](http://railsgirls.com/), that later would become a template for similar projects. A lot of the community was accelerating. That sadly also meant that it became much harder to be a hobbyist Rubyist, if you wanted to follow suit.

There are calls for decelerating Rust. I don't think that is a feasible option. Things will move, if we want it or not. Not being ready to move means letting go of control. Moving at a self-controlled speed is what gives you traction. For that reason, I think now is Rusts "Change" moment. In the following few days, I'd like to have a look at many aspects of the program that can an need to change.
