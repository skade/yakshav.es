# Rust 2019: Foundations

Every time there's a call for paying for Rust features out, someone comes up with the topic of forming a foundation. While there's currently no talks about one, I'd like to explore the questions that this poses.

Foundations at this scope are a nasty beast and sadly not the pixie dusk people expect them to be.

## What should a foundation do?

This seems like an innocious question, but the scope of a foundation is really important.

### Governance

### Event funding

### Development funding

## Who's entitled to form one?

## Who is going to do it?

## How is a foundation resilient?

## Money, Money, Money

## Foundations
