<p>When starting collecting ideas about this years Rust 2019 post, I had far to many to fit into one document. For that reasons, Iâ€™ll start writing multiple small pieces. I might come back to them at a later point this year. Most of my wishes are around the project structure, but I also have some technical ones. Most of them deal with the current growth and maturity of the project.</p>
<p>All of these are living documents and even just drafts, so they might change at any time and might be released in draft form.</p>
