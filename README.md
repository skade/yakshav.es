# yakshav.es

yakshav.es is [my](http://skade.me/profile.html) personal snippet space. It’s for content that doesn’t really merit a longform blog post and stuff that’s longer then a tweet.

Also, while I intend to add a changes feed later, consider all content fundamentally unordered and unfinished. I appreciate friendly discourse about it, as long as these things are kept in mind.

Feel free to interact with me via [github issues](http://github.com/skade/yakshav.es/issues).
