<h1 id="sponsor-florian">Sponsor Florian</h1>
<p>I’ve been doing free community work for almost 20 years and am seeking personal sponsorship. For detailed reasoning, see <a href="/sustainability">Sustainability</a>.</p>
<p>To help out, <a href="mailto:info@asquera.de">get in touch</a>.</p>
<h2 id="from-whom">From whom?</h2>
<p>I am interested in professional, corporate and company donors of any size.</p>
<p>I’m also fine with conferences and can even offer consulting in return. I don’t do diversity consulting.</p>
<h2 id="how-much">How much?</h2>
<p>I’m seeking at least EUR 15.000 for 2018, either in one-off payments or monthly. I prefer to accept your sponsorship through my company, <a href="http://asquera.de">asquera</a>, for ease. We can also negotiate other forms.</p>
<p>More sponsorship would allow me to do more things.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-this-money-help-finance">What does this money help finance?</h2>
<p>Mainly Time. I’m currently involved and/or helping the following projects:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/opentechschool-berlin/">Rust Berlin/Rust Hack &amp; Learn</a></li>
<li><a href="https://rust-lang.org/teams.html">Rust project global community team</a>
<ul>
<li>answering community requests</li>
<li>leading the events subteam</li>
<li>helping global conferences to be better conferences</li>
<li>content team contributor</li>
<li>On-site person at community events</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://youtube.com/c/rustvideos">The Rust YouTube account</a></li>
<li><a href="https://rustfest.eu">RustFest</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/RustLatamConf">helping out Rust LATAM</a></li>
<li><a href="https://paris.rustfest.eu/about_impl_days/">impl days</a></li>
<li><a href="http://rubyberlin.org/">Ruby Berlin e.V.</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.opentechschool.org/">OpenTechSchool e.V.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/TechSpeakers">Mozilla TechSpeakers</a></li>

<li><a href="https://rubyonice.com/2018">RubyOnIce</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Currently, most of this work happens on evenings. Your support would also allow me to refocus on non-Rust things again.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I have a lot of experience that could be of benefit to the wider FOSS community. I would like to spread/write down:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How to plan and run affordable conferences, especially around budgeting</p></li>
<li><p>How to run fair and diverse conferences</p></li>
<li><p>How to interact with conferences</p></li>
<li><p>Approaches to community development</p></li>
<li><p>Writing proposals and speaker mentoring</p></li>
</ul>
<p>One of those projects is the <a href="https://github.com/rust-community/foss-events-planner/">FOSS events planner</a>. It’s under the umbrella of the Rust project, but open and intended for all.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-this-sponsorship-not-for">What is this sponsorship not for?</h2>
<p>Expenses and travel, especially speaking expenses. These are either paid by conferences I speak at or through other means.</p>
<h2 id="what-will-i-provide">What will I provide?</h2>
<p>A regular writeup and worklog of things done, at least once a month. For sponsors over 1000 Euros, we can set up a phone call where I answer all of your questions on FOSS development. On larger sponsorships (&gt;5000), we can also negotiate additional agreements. Also, I’ll present all sponsors on this website and give you thanks :).</p>
