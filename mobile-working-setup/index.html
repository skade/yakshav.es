<h1 id="my-mobile-working-setup">My mobile working setup</h1>
<p>I recently changed my working setup for work. I’d like to document it
here.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>I like writing during travelling. I did, in the beginning, use my
smartphone together with an Apple bluetooth keyboard and liked that
setup for its simplicity. There’s not much more to do on the phone then
the application currently at hand, it is small and usable.</p>
<p>Back when I first tried it out, application support was horrible
though. Because of Apples neglectance of sharing more then files between
applications made even managing of work difficult. So I ended up getting
my notebook out for most stuff again. Also, the setup always had the
problem where to keep the phone…</p>
<p>That has changed with iOS 9 and after tipping my toes in the water
again, I decided to try things again and am quite happy with the
setup.</p>
<p>I don’t want to code using the setup, but get a reasonable preview of
my writing.</p>
<h2 id="the-keyboard">The keyboard</h2>
<p>After quite some research, I opted for a <a
href="https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-us/products/keyboards/universal-mobile-keyboard/p2z-00001">Microsoft
Universal Mobile Keyboard</a>. The keyboard itself is suprisingly hard
to get on short notice.</p>
<p>The keyboard has settings for working as a Windows, Android or iOS
keyboard. It is a standard keyboard with some additional keys for
locking, volume/audio control, and searching. The build quality is
great.</p>
<p>It comes with a rubbery cover that can hold the device you are using
while working. The cover is quite heavy at first, but once you start
using it, it shows why: it holds rock solid. The rubber effect of the
cover also means that the whole setup never moves, neither on a table or
your knees. The device, be it a table or a phone, holds great within the
cover and cannot be pushed over. It can also be adjusted to two
angles.</p>
<p>Microsoft advertises 90 days off standby off one charge and I haven’t
managed to run out of battery.</p>
<p>If you are reading this just for inspiration for a similar setup:
make this piece your cornerstone.</p>
<h2 id="device-ipad-mini-4">Device: iPad Mini 4</h2>
<p>I had bad experiences with the very first iPad and never used a
tablet since then. After some back and forth, I still decided to get one
instead of using my phone, mostly because of the larger size and
seperate battery from my phone.</p>
<p>I opted for not considering an Android device because I already did
my applications research and doing it again would have cost me
additional effort. If you are currently used to Android, possibly
getting an Android tablet of similar proportions is a good way to
go.</p>
<p>The split screen mode took some getting used to, but I really love
it! Most applications I use support it well, making editing a text and
working with a git client alongside a matter of sliding to the left. The
constrained model of having one main app and exactly <em>one</em>
secondary fits my mental model of working really well. If Linux had a
tiling window manager like that, I’d be with you in a second.</p>
<p>Handover between applications works good, although it has some weird
things you need to get used to. The git client I use can only export the
current repository it has open to the text editor I use, which (after
some getting used to), I also enjoy. It means all my applications are
focused on the same thing all the time. It’s not for large-scale use,
but great if you want a setup to flip open and get working.</p>
<p>There’s a few flaws though. Sometimes, my text editor completely
forgets about the data it had open from my git client and I have to
reopen it. That doesn’t incur data loss or something, but is a bit of a
nuisance. It has a straight-forward solution though.</p>
<p>Finally, keyboard integration in iOS proper is really good, providing
shortcuts for many things and even a macOS style application switcher.
The only major nuisance is that you really want to set the key repeat
timing down, and switch of auto-correct. A thing to get used to is that
Backspace works differently in iOS then on macOS. It expects a long
keypress to activate and then takes long to repeat. The idea behind that
seems to be to encourage you to use mark and replace more often and it
definitely works for me after getting an hour of work time with it.</p>
<p>I tried to use Swype keyboard with that setup, but it has bugs that I
cannot understand, like keys suddenly stopping work. Switching back to
the stock iOS keyboard helps.</p>
<p>Battery life is good.</p>
<h2 id="software">Software</h2>
<p>Text editor: Textastic</p>
<p>Textastic has been with iOS for quite a while and it shows. It is
easy to use, and it is definitely set up for serious use. It comes with
an additional keyboard row for easy access to special character (should
you forget your hardware keyboard), has a nice enough file browser and
has a project manager. On top of that, it can run a webserver to provide
preview of rather complex pages in Safari. I currently use it for a
rather complex presentation using reveal.js, and it can provide a full
preview setup of that.</p>
<p>On top of that, it has quick preview of popular markup languages,
like markdown, built-in.</p>
<p>Git: Git2Go</p>
<p>Git2Go provides a good interface to Git(Hub), though my main
motivation for buying it a while ago was that it was the only client
that could handle GH accounts with access to more then 50 repositories
(one page in the GitHub API). But it handles project, branch, and commit
management good, along with being a provider for the data to other
applications. It does allow preview and seeing commits. It works great
as a side application.</p>
<p>GitHub: iOctocat</p>
<p>As a heavy user on the iPhone, I also love iOctocat on the iPad. It
provides a great overview of everything that happens around you and is
my goto application to get up to speed. My only gripes are that it
cannot create pull requests and it is not available in the sidebar.</p>
<p>Browser: Firefox &amp; Klar</p>
<p>Firefox for iOS is a great browser that replaced Safari for me very
quickly. I can additionally recommend Firefox Klar, which has a great,
focused exerience for looking stuff up: no history, just one tab, always
in private mode. Does not clutter your history.</p>
<p>Game for in between: FTL</p>
<p>FTL (Faster than Light) is still one of the best tablet games ever
build. Complex, well tuned for touch input and in that case, touch
controls have that certain Star Trek feel to them.</p>
<p>Problematic App: Chat Secure</p>
<p>Chat Secure is nice and great, but has weird layout issues on an iPad
mini, especially in split screen mode.</p>
