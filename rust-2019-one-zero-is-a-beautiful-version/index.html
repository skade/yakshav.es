<p>When I wrote last years post, <a href="https://yakshav.es/rust-2018">Rust 2018: The year we learn Rust 1.0</a>, I tried to make an argument to focus on ecosystem improvements over language improvements. I specifically called out 2 spaces: a stable http client and documented async ecosystem.</p>

<p>When I wrote last year’s post, <a href="https://yakshav.es/rust-2018">Rust 2018: The year we learn Rust 1.0</a>, I tried to make an argument to focus on ecosystem improvements over language improvements. I specifically called out 2 spaces: a stable http client and documented async ecosystem.</p>
>>>>>>> next
<p>1 year in, the situation is the same: we still don’t have a 1.0 HTTP client in our ecosystem. While <code>hyper</code> and <code>reqwest</code> are still the go-to libraries and good, they are still not committed to stability. Also, no other library has emerged to fill that hole. The more our ecosystem grows, the larger the community-wide cost of following breaking changes in these libraries will get.</p>
<p>Proper, high-level documentation of async/futures was pushed tied to the arrival of <code>async/await</code>, which was targeted for the edition release and later shifted back. I like <code>async/await</code>, I still think the decision to tie documentation to it was a mistake.</p>
<p>This has a ripple effect: everything based on these libraries and features will hold back committing to stability: web and API frameworks, other network protocol implementations or even just plain tutorials.</p>
<p>I don’t want to shift blame on anyone and not speculate on reasons. There’s tons of people working hard on all these features, doing a lot of great work. But as much as I <em>internally</em> have a lot of empathy for this situation, <em>externally</em>, this becomes a problem.</p>
<<<<<<< HEAD
<p>While this was a (large) wart a year ago, three years in, it now quickly becomes unacceptable - especially for a language that boasts safe asynchronicity and network programming close to the metal. It points to an immaturity and indecisiveness of the ecosystem. It adds to a feeling of ongoing insecurity about the path of our fundamental ecosystem. Rust is going to become a tough sell through that. Last year, “Rust is young” was an argument that was acceptable. It slowly begins to wear off. We chose to use “Rust 2018” as a “Rust has grown up” marketing moment, and our ecosystem should reflect that.</p>
<p>I think projects like <a href="https://github.com/rust-net-wg/tide">tide</a> point into the right direction: a concerted effort by a <em>team</em> of people to build a reliable, stable offering that is a stable workload.</p>
<p>We had our year of language fixup. We need a year of finishing the parts of the ecosystem that are generally considered expected for the course for any major programming language.</p>
<p>1.0 is a beautiful version, and we need to commit to it. (and subsequently tag)</p>
