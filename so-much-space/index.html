<p>I have recently been a bit floating when it comes to Rusts community work. Not because there’s something amiss, but because there is seemingly not that much amiss. Autopilot on, go. Write a comment here, run a meetup there, RustFest this.</p>
<p>Feedback is great, new events are popping up left and right and some metrics, we are making faster progress then others. Also, there’s not many metrics at all for the kind of work the Rust community team does.</p>
