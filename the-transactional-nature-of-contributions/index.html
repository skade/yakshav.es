<h1 id="the-transactional-nature-of-foss-contributions">The
transactional nature of FOSS contributions</h1>
<p>With FOSS becoming ubiquitous in recent years, we run into more on
more problems in the maintainer/user relationship. The more I try to
read up on this, the more I figure that many people on both sides lack a
proper model of this - and that leads to friction.</p>
<p>It also leads to a lot of weird discussions around license text. But
- to paraphrase Douglas Adams - it isn’t the legal texts that are
unhappy, but the maintainers and users. While I appreciate and welcome a
lot of discussions around licensing, they are also often used to dodge
<em>other, also hard discussions</em>. They serve a different goal.</p>
<p>And one of the current hard discussions comes down to one problem:
we’ve set up FOSS as the biggest barter deal in humanity. That worked as
long as every party is employed with a fat wage check at a software
company already and influx manageable. It doesn’t work in times in which
FOSS projects are easily the size of <em>mid-size</em> companies
themselves or individual projects become used in software of global
scale.</p>
<p>Which is where this whole thing boomerangs: we managed to set up a
space where we don’t talk about money. And that is on <em>us</em>, the
software builders, who want money from people who have absolutely no
problem to talk about transactions.</p>
<h2 id="modelling-the-relationship">Modelling the relationship</h2>
<p>Many people model contribution to a project as a <em>selfless
act</em> and expect <em>gratitude</em> back. The are surprised when that
isn’t the case. The problem is that sending someone a patch is not like
sending them a present.</p>
<p>Let’s see what a patch usually involves (I’m not going to go into
details here):</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The change needs to be planned
<ul>
<li>Does it fit the projects plans?</li>
<li>Does it need architectural change to fit?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The change needs to be developed.</li>
<li>The change needs to be integrated and tested.</li>
<li>The change needs to be documented, communicated and maintained into
perpetuity.</li>
</ol>
<p>Meta: followup patches might go through this whole cycle again.</p>
<p>Assuming the party that sends the patch is not already within the
organisation producing the software, an external contribution forms an
<em>external relationship</em>. The usual term for the receiving side is
the <em>upstream</em>, the sending side is the <em>contributor</em> (an
individual, often representing a company). Depending on the age and the
trust level of that relationship, that means substantial parts of the
above points <em>cannot</em> be given to the outside party. Also, as
every relationship, <em>early relationships</em> incur the highest cost
- in time and care.</p>
<p>Which brings the question why the external party contributes. Let’s
list some reasons:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>They found a bug and need it solved</li>
<li>They would find an additional feature for the software useful and
maintenance upstream is much cheaper then on top (which may mean a
fork)</li>
<li>They provide a platform and support for their platform could be
useful for them.</li>
<li>They are just hacking and would like to hack on your stuff.</li>
</ol>
<p>All these are entirely reasonable.</p>
<h2 id="a-very-sloppy-calculation">A very sloppy calculation</h2>
<p>It is not unsual to break things down to <em>one</em> cost factor
(which is where the saying “time is money”) comes from. Usually,
companies calculate on money, but there <em>are</em> e.g. companies
(especially in manufacturing environments) that mainly calculate on
time. Keep that in mind whenever I speak about cost.</p>
<p>Now, here’s the thing: the cost of any transaction is never zero for
both sides. The contributor needs to spend time developing their thing,
the maintainer needs time vetting it. It is also impossible to ever push
this to zero for any of those sides. Even at the bare minimum - e.g. me
sending you a typo fix - you still need to hit the merge button and - to
not be a complete hearless person - post “Thank you”.</p>
<p>This game is more complex for maintainers though, as they need to pay
the cost of <em>the sum of all contributions</em> (and this includes
maintenance), while a contributor only pays <em>their individual</em>
contribution and have no commitment to further maintenance.</p>
<h2 id="the-calculation-is-contextual">The calculation is
contextual</h2>
<p>What I described above is very normal and not at all problematic per
se, as long as both sides are happy. But there’s many context in
play.</p>
<h3 id="mission">Mission</h3>
<p>The first one is mission and goals.</p>
<p>For example a project whos mission it is to build a programming
language supporting as many platforms as possible <em>needs</em>
contributions from experts on those platform. The cost of maintenance
may be controllable. Both sides shake hands, everyone is happy. This
calculation will also get better the more the relationship builds.</p>
<p>The very same situation may lead to problems if upstream was never
planning or only reluctantly supporting Windows/Linux/PDP-11. They would
spend time on something that doesn’t forward their goals. Given that
they have finite resources, resources spent on your desire take away
from reaching their goals.</p>
<p>The latter is a classic <em>goal mismatch</em>. This This
relationship can never work well, until the goal of upstream changes. It
will always build aggrevation.</p>
<p>Many Linux distributions and larger companies understood this and
instead maintain their own patchsets rather than upstreaming. There’s
problems there if things that can actually be upstreamed well aren’t,
but that’s for other blog posts.</p>
<p>Another solution is to actually change the goals of upstream. While
there is certainly convincing to do, the dominant component here is:
<em>you need to have a plan cover upstreams cost</em>. I’ll come to that
later.</p>
<h2 id="the-work-of-acceptance-is-unmanageable">The work of acceptance
is unmanageable</h2>
<p>This is subtle and not often appreciated: the work of accepting an
incoming change for <em>upstream</em> might outweigh the cost of
developing it themselves. This is often the case why patches “out of the
blue” don’t work.</p>
<p>The situation here is that the <em>cost of acceptance</em> is huge.
For example, because there was no discussion about whether the proposed
change even makes sense before it arrived (if you ever worked in a
software project where requirements were sudden, imagine your CEO comes
to your desk with the code already written). Or because the change is
fundamental, huge and requires a slice of time to review that no one can
set aside - and chances of failure there are high. In this case, the
cost for <em>contributors</em> does not even matter and can be anything
from low to extremely high.</p>
<p>Depending on how you end up in the situation, there might be a fix
available (and you might have guessed it): <em>you need to have a plan
cover upstreams cost</em>. And a plan for upstream to actually be ready
when the truck comes down the road.</p>
<h2 id="upstream-is-overloaded">Upstream is overloaded</h2>
<p>This is a modern classic. There’s been a lot of practices growing
over the years on how to <em>attract contributors</em>. But those plans
often ignore the fact that contribution never comes for free for any
side. This is the problem that <a
href="https://blog.domenic.me/hacktoberfest/">Hacktoberfest</a> ran
into, figuring out that not all maintainers appreciate contribution
(especially not of the low value kind). They are now finally opt-in.</p>
<p>Let’s quickly talk about what <em>overloaded</em> means: this just
means the cost of accepting all current changes is larger than all
currently available resources. This does not mean that a contributors
patch is in and by itself unmanageable. You can easily detect such
cases: patch merge times jump suddenly. This is because this often makes
<em>upstream</em> struggle with priotisation, which introduces friction.
Overload is dangerous, as it affects <em>overall productivity</em>,
leading to a downward spiral.</p>
<p>There’s two solutions for this: aggressively shedding load, which
means closing potential contributions unseen. Or, alternative, strictly
prioritising who gets first and hope bandwidth can be increased in the
future.</p>
<p>Solutions to this problem? <em>You need to cover upstreams cost</em>.
You might have guessed it.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-we-cover-upstreams-cost">How do we cover upstreams
cost?</h2>
<p>Now, I mentioned this multiple times, so how do we cover upstreams
cost? This is where we need to get out of the abstract - it is highly
dependend on the nature of their operations. Let’s rule out two things
first:</p>
<p>If upstream is a company selling a piece of software that happens to
be open source, I have bad news for you: probably, you can’t. They
probably get money for their operations from elsewhere and goalsetting
is not informed by their GitHub PR section. You are probably either in a
<em>goal misalignment</em> situation and it will be impossible to change
the goals or in an <em>unmanageable acceptance</em> situation, because
the decision and planning structure within the company is hidden and
doesn’t take you into account. Even if you are a paying customer, the
best way to get a feature implemented is your manager calling their
account manager - and that will only work if a sufficient amount of
other customers have the same request.</p>
<p>Another case is where the upstream has never intended the project to
be used for anything serious and does not wish to build the needed
structures - this is not uncommon. The solution here is to fork and use
the software for your own. It’s still good curtesy to send them a note
and maybe offer them to receive money for help with your fork.</p>
<p>In all other cases, there’s a number of options and often, a
combination of them makes things work. The first one is to find some way
to present committment - the strongest, and somewhat easiest one being
to actually join upstream. This is particularly great if your
contribution is a large feature - you bring the maintenance. The larger
the contribution, the larger the expectency to be part of its future
maintenance are. The second is straight-forward: money. If upstream
accepts money, send it. There’s many ways of doing this: some projects
have organisations to spend money towards (this is a long game, though),
but for other projects, some maintainers are freelancers or have small
companies and will assist you through you buying time. No guaranteee of
merging, usually, but - at least to get matters closed.</p>
<p>There’s the special case in which upstream is a commercial company
that <em>does</em> facilitate open contribution and design. In this
case, contribution not working is a quality problem.</p>
<p>And finally: You have a problem to get money for that green-lighted
in your organisation? That’s your organisations issue. This includes
multi-billion dollar companies that just happen to not have the
facilities in accounting for doing that. You probably can’t fix it, but
immediately remove yourself from any of the above situations and report
that internally.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-we-convince-people-to-cover-upstreams-cost">How do we
convince people to cover upstreams cost?</h2>
<p>Which brings me to the other side of the question: how do we, as
maintainers, convince people to cover our cost?</p>
<p>The first question is: do you, as maintainers, accept money? If the
answer is “No” (which is valid), then try to get as many co-maintainers
as you can. If the cost of acceptance outweigh the benefits for your
goal, send people away. Feel good about it.</p>
<p>But what if you want to get cash? First of all, by setting aside some
time for making this happen. It’s a skill to build and arguments need to
be made. A problem here is that many people feel uncomfortable to talk
about or ask for money. From the perspective of a maintainer, an
interesting observation applies: potential spenders <em>also</em> have
finite resources for that spend, why should they give it to you? (hint:
the license of your project is secondary here)</p>
<p>It’s rather the list of reasons I layed out in the beginning:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>They found a bug and need it solved</li>
<li>They would find an additional feature for the software useful and
maintenance upstream is much cheaper then on top (which may mean a
fork)</li>
<li>They provide a platform and support for their platform could be
useful for them.</li>
<li>They are just hacking and would like to hack on your stuff.</li>
</ol>
<p>Other way put:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>They have a pain to solve, probably quick</li>
<li>They want to optimise cost</li>
<li>They need your product to run on their product to reduce blockers
(and as such cost)</li>
</ol>
<p>Our core problem is that for a long time, we’ve accepted this kind of
contribution without question. That means we got people <em>used</em> to
this being valid reasons to contribute without any kind of longer
investment or caring about their cost. This leads to the absurd
situation that when <em>asked</em> for the their cost, projects can
often not account for them, not even the slightest. Another problem is
that we often accepted <em>barter deals</em> to dodge money -
e.g. hardware to test. The problem is that this a) keeps you inflexible
and b) congratulations, you now have hardware to manage. And - to
paraphrase Douglas Adams again - the hardware wasn’t unhappy, it was the
people. And… we conveniently dodged the uncomfortable money topic.</p>
<p>Money has the large advantage of being <em>flexible</em> and
<em>under your control</em>. You can buy food <em>and</em> other
conveninces from it, a problem that modern processor development as not
solved yet (the nutrition value of processors is pretty terrible).</p>
<p>But this also means that we often haven’t modeled what <em>value</em>
we bring when we accept these contributions. And that’s our entry-point
into a discussion.</p>
<p>Especially corporate contributors are interested in multiple things:
reducing their own organisational load (which incurs cost), freeing
their own resources (which otherwise incurs costs, often opportunity
costs) and enabling future business. Any argument on why you can improve
those axes is well rooted. Be aware that engineers, often up to and
including CTOs often don’t think along those lines. You want to talk to
people with budget powers - people who know what the value of a
transaction is. Find ways to connect them to your work (e.g. by sending
a monthly update on the work they funded - a small page).</p>
<p>Only even discuss deals with a money component (rare exceptions
exist). Again, money means <em>value, (your) flexibility, appreciation
and commitment</em>. Send people away that don’t want to discuss on
those terms, they are not serious. Deflect anything that tries to argue
over internal problems on the contributing side: that’s their problem to
solve. Also, no 20% time (unless it’s committed to your projects
management).</p>
<p>For all others, be aware that the cost of an engineer day interally
at a company is rarely under 1000$ and that setting up a deal with you
will probably cost multiple days for multiple people at that company.
This is <em>working to your advantage</em>, because it leads to an odd
effect: companies are not interested in your patreon for 50$ max - the
cost of <em>that</em> transaction is far outweighting the monetary. If
you want to approach companies, reach for higher values, but also with
higher touch. For example, you may want to bring tiny commitments
(e.g. the right to call you personally in a very constrained fashion,
once a month or so).</p>
<p>The numbers here may change, but as an illustration: the first thing
I killed at my conferences was the 500$ sponsorship and it -
counter-intuitively - <em>improved sales</em>. The effect is something
an experienced sales person will not be confused about: it acts as a
filter and we were below the line where professional sponsors would
call. It also improved our fulfilling their expectations: an hour or two
of our time for the sales process and sponsorship. The math here is
simple: 1 hour each to chase 2 500$ sponsorships or 2 hours to chase 1
1000$ sponsorship? The second is better, as you only end up with one
relationship to manage and one set of invoices to manage. Often, it also
turned out that the high-volume sales were actually faster.</p>
<p>There’s a certain amount to sales strategy here, but that’s a) hard
to generalise and b) maybe meriting another piece of writing.</p>
<p>That leaves 4., the hobbyist contributors:</p>
<p>They are probably a student or someone who just enjoys the work.
Decide to work with them or not. I can recommend the first, I had a lot
of personal fun coming out of it. When you are in their town, ask for
their couch instead of paying for a hotel.</p>
