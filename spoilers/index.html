      <p>I don’t care about spoilers, be it for video games or movies. I’m quite happy to have them and I think good discussions about both need to discuss specifics of story and especially twists. I generally ask before doing so, but as this is no conversation, but my personal space, I’ll just write whatever I want. Heed the warning.</p>
      <p>On top of that, I’m heavily reliant on spoilers in certain aspects and generally read up on movies before seeing them. There’s not a lot of resources for that.</p>
