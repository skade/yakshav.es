<h1 id="spoilers">Spoilers</h1>
<p>I don’t care about spoilers, be it for video games or movies. I’m
quite happy to have them and I think good discussions about both need to
discuss specifics of story and especially twists. I generally ask before
doing so, but as this is no conversation, but my personal space, I’ll
just write whatever I want. Heed the warning.</p>
<p>On top of that, I’m heavily reliant on spoilers in certain aspects
and generally read up on movies before seeing them. There’s not a lot of
resources for that.</p>
