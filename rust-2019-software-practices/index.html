<p>Another thing I highlighted in <a href="https://yakshav.es/rust-2018">Rust 2018: The year we learn Rust 1.0</a> is the need to develop software practices at scale. I have a positive view on our progress there.</p>
<p>Crucial tooling like <code>cargo generate</code> are in a good shape, a great example for this are the project setups in the <a href="TODO:%20Link">embedded book</a>. It allows us to pre-ship reasonable application structures. Iâ€™m a huge fan of it and hope for a wider adoption. In my book, <code>cargo generate</code> should replace <code>cargo new --bin</code> in most cases in the future.</p>
<p>But also, patterns developed, like the ownership patterns around drivers, as presented in <a href="TODO:%20Link">James Munns talk at RustConf</a>. But beyond embedded, discussions around high-level details have emerged. One great example here are <a href="TODO:%20Link">Nikos office hours</a>. Construction and composition of large systems is hard to explain in the void. They are often context sensitive. Taking a conversational approach by answering community questions out of our own experience seems like a good plan here.</p>
<p>With the upcoming stabilisation of <code>async/await</code>, I hope that we will see a lot of patterns emerge here more clearly as well.</p>
