<p>Far too much time is spent complaining about how everything is broken and computers suck.</p>
<p>Sometimes, if your problem is 2 programs fighting over handling a file, remember that there’s around a million lines of code to just run these two programs, running on around a billion transistors and that both of this programs probably contain at least 1000 decisions. Sure, it could all be better, but it’s amazing that we even reached this point.</p>
